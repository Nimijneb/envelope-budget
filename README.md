# Ebb and Flow

> **Disclaimer:** this project is 100% vibe coded. There may be security issues that I do not know to look for.

A small, self-hosted envelope budgeting app with **households** (shared budgets) and multiple envelopes per household. Each envelope has a **starting balance** when created; you then record **Ebb** (money out) and **Flow** (money in). Current balance is: starting balance plus the sum of all transactions.

Inspired by [Goodbudget](https://goodbudget.com/) and [Envelopes](https://envlps.com/), with fewer features on purpose.

## Features

- **Locked sign-up**: there is no public registration. Set **`ADMIN_USERNAME`** and **`ADMIN_PASSWORD`** in the environment; on first start the server creates (or promotes) that admin. The admin signs in and uses **Add a family member** on the dashboard to create accounts for everyone else. Accounts use **usernames** only (no email).
- Optional **`ALLOW_OPEN_REGISTRATION=true`** (development only) re-enables `POST /api/auth/register`.
- Sign in (JWT, bcrypt passwords)
- **Households**: each account belongs to one household; family members share envelopes.
- Create envelopes with a starting balance (in dollars; stored as cents)
- List envelopes with running balance (shared with the household)
- Per-envelope transaction log (Ebb or Flow, optional note; shows who recorded each entry)
- Delete an envelope (and its transactions)
- Single container: API + static web UI

## Development

Requires Node.js 20+.

```bash
npm install
npm run dev
```

- API: [http://127.0.0.1:4000](http://127.0.0.1:4000) (set `JWT_SECRET` in `.env` for stable tokens)
- Vite dev server: [http://127.0.0.1:5173](http://127.0.0.1:5173) (proxies `/api` to the API)

Create a `.env` in the repo root or under `server/`:

```env
JWT_SECRET=your-long-random-secret-at-least-16-chars
ADMIN_USERNAME=your-admin-username
ADMIN_PASSWORD=your-initial-admin-password
```

`ADMIN_EMAIL` is still accepted as a fallback for the admin username if `ADMIN_USERNAME` is unset.

Without admin env vars and an empty database, no one can sign in until you set them and restart (unless you use `ALLOW_OPEN_REGISTRATION=true` for dev).

Production build (writes the SPA into `server/public` and compiles the server):

```bash
npm run build
npm run start
```

## Docker

Create a `.env` next to `docker-compose.yml`:

```env
JWT_SECRET=your-long-random-secret
ADMIN_USERNAME=your-admin-username
ADMIN_PASSWORD=your-initial-admin-password
```

Then:

```bash
docker compose up -d --build
```

Open [http://localhost:4000](http://localhost:4000).

Data is stored in the `envelope_budget_data` volume at `DATABASE_PATH` (`/data/envelopes.db` in the compose file).

### Pre-built image (no clone)

This repo can publish a **free** image to **GitHub Container Registry** (`ghcr.io`) using the workflow in `.github/workflows/docker-publish.yml`. It runs on every push to `main` (and on version tags like `v1.0.0`).

1. Push `main` on GitHub and wait for the **Publish Docker image** action to finish (Actions tab).
2. In **Packages** (your profile or org), open the `envelope-budget` package and set **visibility to Public** if you want anyone to `docker pull` without logging in.
3. On a server, only a `.env` and compose file are needed:

```bash
curl -fsSL -o docker-compose.image.yml https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Nimijneb/envelope-budget/main/docker-compose.image.yml
# Edit image: line if you use a fork (ghcr.io/<your-username>/envelope-budget:latest)
echo 'JWT_SECRET=...' > .env
echo 'ADMIN_USERNAME=...' >> .env
echo 'ADMIN_PASSWORD=...' >> .env
docker compose -f docker-compose.image.yml pull
docker compose -f docker-compose.image.yml up -d
```

Open [http://localhost:4000](http://localhost:4000).

## Environment

| Variable                   | Description |
|----------------------------|-------------|
| `JWT_SECRET`               | Secret for signing tokens (use a strong value) |
| `ADMIN_USERNAME`         | Username for the household admin (seeded on startup). `ADMIN_EMAIL` is used if this is unset (legacy). |
| `ADMIN_PASSWORD`           | Password for that admin when the account is first created (min 8 chars) |
| `ALLOW_OPEN_REGISTRATION`  | Set to `true` to allow `POST /api/auth/register` (dev only; default off) |
| `DATABASE_PATH`            | SQLite file path (default: `./data/envelopes.db` from server cwd) |
| `PORT`                     | HTTP port (default `4000`) |
| `CORS_ORIGIN`              | Optional browser origin for CORS |
